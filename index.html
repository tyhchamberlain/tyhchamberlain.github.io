                <p><strong>Spectra of Metric Graphs (a.k.a. Quantum Graphs)</strong> </p>
                <p>A <em> metric graph</em> is a graph \(G\) along with a metric \(\ell\) assigning lengths to its edges. The pair \((G,\ell)\) has the structure of a singular Riemannian manifold. One can then study its <em>spectrum</em> or the collection of eigenvalues of its Laplace operator, where eigenfunctions are subject to certain conditions at the vertices of \(G\). For instance, we can require that Kirkoff's current law holds at each vertex, in which case, the metric graph can be thought of as a model for an electric circuit.</p>
                  
                  <p>I am interested in how the topology of \(G\) influences the behavior of the generic eigenfunction. The main object of focus is the <em>secular manifold</em> \(\Sigma_G\) which compresses the spectra of all possible metric graphs on \(G\) into a single real analytic set. Many properties, such as vanishing along edges and vertices, are coded as real analytic subsets of \(\Sigma_G\). My most recent paper (link to arXiv preprint above) studies the singular locus of \(\Sigma_G\) when \(G\) is a compact tree. </p>

                <p><strong>Triangularity</strong> </p>
                <p>Poncelet's Porism states that for two plane conics \(C, D\), there are either infinitely many polgons inscribed in \(C\) and circumscribed about \(D\) or none at all. The problem can be interpreted in an enumerative sense: <em>How many \(n\)-gons are inscribed in \(C\) and circumscribed about \(D\) when the curves are in general position?</em> For conics, the answer is zero for every \(n\); this is Poncelet's Porism. For general curves, the answer remains largely unknown. In the 1800s, Schubert produced a formula for the number of triangles between smooth curves, which was later corrected by Alberto Collino & William Fulton.</p>
                <p>Singularities introduce a number of difficulties. In particular, as we degenerate a smooth curve into a singular one, we produce degenerate triangles, i.e. where two edges or two points agree, which we must avoid counting. The impact of a singularity on the enumerative formula depends on its analytic-isomorphism class. This produces a curious plane curve singularity, called <em>triangularity</em>. For an exact definition, please see the draft (in preparation) above.</p>
